Logic For Peice Mover:

    0) it starts as player 1's turn.

    1) make sure the Selected Piece is yours.

    1) check if it is a black Square

    1) check if there is a piece alreay there,
        if a piece is there, the movment is a failure.
    2) check that the distance of the move is not more than 2 squares moved

    3) if it was moved more than 1, (this is a jump) check that there is an 
    enemy piece in the inbetween square.

    4) if a succsessulf jump was done, it remains that players turn.
